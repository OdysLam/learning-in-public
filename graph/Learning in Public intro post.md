- ## TL;DR 
- Just visit the [Symposium graph](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/Symposium/page/t9PFemV3W) and I will see you there ✌️
- ## Building in Public
- The __building in public__ movement is something that I only recently discovered. Basically, you pick a medium, like twitter, and you treat it as your personal journal while you build __something__.
- There a lot of very successful startups and founders who have perfected this __art__. For example, @shl from @gumroad shares his insights from running a startup and being a creator, making it an awesome account to follow. Not only I get to share the thrill of doing something with a sense of mission, but I also learn about running a startup and being a creator.  
-  In a lot of ways, building in public shares a lot of attributes with __open source__ projects. You get to build in a way where everyone can see your victories and defeats.
- The upside of this all, apart from gathering a following who is rooting for your success, is that you get a very tightly-packed feedback loop. This constant back and forth of ideas between you and the community is not only invigorating for the spirit but a source of inspiration and a necessity for effective rapid iteration. It's rocket fuel 🚀 for learning.
- With that in mind, today I am announcing an experiment of mine. A system to **Learn in Public**.
- ## Learning in Public
- It's an effort to bring all my learning efforts out in the open, for anyone to leverage for their own understanding.
- I spend a considerable time of my every day learning new things. Instead of learning into a vacuum, I will be logging my thoughts, insights, and "Aha!" moments as I research a particular subject.
- Every subject will have a corpus of knowledge, like a **tree trunk** which will be complemented with a number of insights, like branches. Each insight should clarify some part of the main corpus while offering external resources for further reading. 
- That way, you should be able to greatly accelerate your learning on the same subject.  Hopefully, this effort will accumulate into a rich repository of various subjects, which could be possibly enriched by people of the community. 
- Learning is fun, especially when you share it with other people. This mental tango is so much more useful and productive than banging your head against the wall. Feedback is a crucial ingredient of learning. 
- The idea is that it will beneficial to everyone. It will force me to approach learning in an even more systematic manner, and benefit others by laying out a path for learning a particular subject. 
- ## Why learning?
- I have always been good at learning new ideas, new concepts. It's something that I enjoy and I suspect that is the very reason that I am good at it. 
- I think everyone knows at least a person that would always spout that random Wikipedia-style fact about the matter at hand. Well, I was that person. I would literally read Wikipedia about everything that poked my interest. I remember once that [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia) was mentioned in a discussion and I was baffled because I didn't know **anything** about the country. I remember thinking to myself:  "Awesome, let's spend the next hour learning some facts about Russia" How is it organized? What is geography? What about the economy?". I very crisply remember reading that its GDP is actually smaller than the GDP of Italy. For some unknown reason, I was fascinated by that, useless for all that matters, detail.  
- You see, this love of learning about things was not visible to me. It was a natural part of my psyche, __distinct__ __but__ __invisible__. Like a pane of glass, it exists but you don't "see" it, you see through it. It served me well, as I was able to excel in school and later in the university, without studying too much. Considering the number of irrelevant projects that I did, I was gliding through courses.
- But, **there is no such thing as a free lunch**. This "aptitude" to learn things was only available when I __wanted__ to learn something. My discipline ~~was~~ is terrible. It was particularly terrible when I had to do something that I considered unimportant, like learning a couple of formulas by heart. 
- For that reason, I was never __great__. I was just good if and whenever I decided to be. I suppose this is because I never observed my inclination in learning different subjects and placing them together in a mental map, being able to retrieve them at will. Quite simply, academic studying was not about that. 
- A big chunk of [[learning how to learn]] has been the ability to quickly find the right content. Leverage the power of the internet** to quickly **identify** and consume the **next** lego **piece** that I need in order to advance my understanding of a particular subject. 
- ## A revelation
- In a way, this is still the way that I am operating, working furiously for the things that I feel passionate about. Thankfully, life is far more modifiable than the curriculum of a Master's program, so I am able to work on what I love, doing what I love, and learning about the things that I love.
- After years of perfecting the art of "googling", I developed a sort of memory technique, where I would store the "existence" of the piece and a couple of metadata that describes it. 
- I did not need to remember the content of that piece of information, only the fact that it exists and the metadata that will facilitate its retrieval. With google always being at arm's reach, I could vastly increase the number of available data that I have at any point in time, by simply being able to easily retrieve them.
- During a work discussion, a colleague and friend pointed out that I always seemed to have readily some random content relevant to the discussion. He thought that I had a library or something. 
- I was puzzled. For me, finding things on the internet has always been so normal and easy, that I thought it was trivial. Well, apparently it wasn't. 
- I spent a couple of days reflecting on that fact. Everything fell together. I decided to start taking detailed notes while researching or learning about things. It was hard-it still is because taking notes is far slower than just __doing™️__, but it was well worth the effort. After a couple of weeks, I had a very detailed log of all the things that I had learned, all the insights that I gathered, and of course dozens of links for websites that went deeper into a particular subject.
- ## Sharing is caring
- I immediately thought to myself "that could be useful to people", since chances are that others would have the same questions that I had when going through that corpus of knowledge. Instead of sharing a series of blog posts, I opted to do something different. 
- You see, I have a thing for tools for knowledge. Others are into BDSM, I am into Roam Research. 
- Why not create a living, breathing graph of knowledge. Instead of creating static artefacts, I will create a central, interconnected living repository of all the things that are of interest to me.  Not only I will have the chance to practice my note-taking skills and create a [[Zettelkasten]], but this could evolve into a living community. 
- A community about learning in public and exchanging ideas while we learn about a particular subject. Why do we have to belong to different communities? Humans are multi-dimensional beings. We can read about [Solidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidity) and at the same time reflect the writings of [José Ortega y Gasset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Ortega_y_Gasset). 
- ### Enter the Symposium
- I opted to name this public space after the [Symposium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symposium_(Plato)), the famous work of Plato. As we read in Wikipedia,
- > It depicts a friendly contest of extemporaneous speeches given by a group of notable men attending a banquet
- Well, you can think this space as our banquet, where we chat and share our learnings about the things that we are interested in.
- I feel that I have written enough. Just visit the [Symposium graph](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/Symposium/page/t9PFemV3W) and I will see you there ✌️
