- Type: #project #meta
- [[project description]]
    - **This is a meta-project, as it concerns this very platform that you are reading**. Here I strategize and plan the development and evolution of this project, both the graph and the relevant artifacts (e.g blog posts). Everything in public. 
- [[project brainstorming]]
    - {{[[TODO]]}} What about adding a start/end date in every #kanban item, so that I can keep track of when I start and finish each item?
- [[project value]]
    - Gotchas and insights that are result of **hands on experience**, when things donâ€™t go as planned in the tutorial
    - Tutorial about subjects that they are interested about, with technical value (how to do X). 
    - Introduction to a subject with curated resources to continue their work.
    - [[project future]] Study group of people who are reading/researching same domain/subject
    - Self-improvement. Meta knowledge, Learn about learning systems of others and how to learn. 
        - This is not the same as when the subject is productivity itself. This is about observing the systems of a person who is learning about whatever subject.
    - **Entertainment, not a dry tutorial. Memes, music, and pop culture interweaved into the project.**
- [[project persona]]
    - Person who is interested in breaking into the domain specific subject. He is young and still learning the ropes
    - A person who is tired of learning around and is searching for their tribe. 
    - People who want to learn but they keep procrastinating, so they ease their thought by following something they deem productive (like productivity YouTube channels).
