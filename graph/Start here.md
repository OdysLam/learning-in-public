- ## Welcome to the Symposium
    - This is my personal learning repository. A place to refine my ideas and share my insights, in **public**. Learning is so much more fun when you share it, so that is what we are going to do here. 
- ## What should I care?
    - **That is a good question indeed**. For starters, you get to access to curated content about various topics. Hopefully, if you are interested in them, it will make your life **easier**. 
    - Why scour the Internet when you can follow  __structured content__ to get you going **fast**.
    - To store the information and interconnect it nicely, we are going to use **Roam Research**.   
    - If you are unfamiliar with Roam Research, visit [[Learn Roam Research]] to learn more about it.
    - My **goal** is **not** to repeat content that exists on the internet, but curates it and __interweave__ my __thoughts__ and __insights__. 
    - Think of this graph as a trunk of a large tree. You start from the base and you follow your interests, with multiple external contents branching out to any direction.  Just follow the core structure, find the topic that interests you and start reading.
- ## Locations of Knowledge
    - This page serves as a central __index__ of all the subjects that I am currently learning or planning to learn in the near future. Simply click on [[Locations of Knowledge]] and follow the page that interests you.
    - ## How to read this category 
        1. The insights are not meant to be all-inclusive, but complementary resources. Follow the instructions at the start of the Insights.
        2. Insights are meant to **greatly accelerate** your learning process of the original material that they accompany. 
        3. This should be collaborative. If you have any questions, just jump into **Discord:** https://discord.gg/vJ5FRbQg. 
        4. If you want to enrich the content, let's chat in the **Discord** channel.
        5. If you are unfamiliar with Roam Research, visit [[Learn Roam Research]] to learn more about it.
        6. Think of this as a trunk of a tree. A body of knowledge that branches into different subjects. All subjects (branches) have [[external resources]], so you can research further into the subject.
            - For example, click on the following image for an example from [[Learn Solidity]], where the insights were generated while following [Crypto Zombies](https://cryptozombies.io/)

- ## Engage
    - __Platforms__
        - **Discord:** https://discord.gg/vJ5FRbQg
            - __Note__: Ideally, I would like to join an already existing community. chat groups fatigue is real and I don't want to double down on the fragmentation of people's time/communities. That being said, I am unaware of relevant communities. If you happen to know, please hit me up.
        - **Twitter:** https://twitter.com/odysseas_lam
    - At this point, the best contribution you can do, apart from content, is feedback.  Just hit me up in **Discord** or **Twitter**. 
    - If you want to contribute content, just hit me up on Discord and let's chat. Roam Research does not offer a lot of colab tools (e.g like GitHub PRs), so we will need to work this out. 
        - Don't worry, you will get full recognition for the content you will contribute. I want this to be a shared effort. ✌️
